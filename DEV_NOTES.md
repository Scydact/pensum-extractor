# Notes for myself

## To deploy to gh-pages
Run `npm run predeploy` and then `npm run deploy`. `predeploy` is necessary as it runs the `build` script.

Thanks to [this guide](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages/tree/master).

For more info, check [gh-pages npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages).

PS: The `npm run start` script may not work on mac/linux, since I modified it to set the env variable `PUBLIC_URL=''` so that localhost is not broken.


## Beautiful hooks
This React page is using [Beautiful React Hooks](https://antonioru.github.io/beautiful-react-hooks/).

## Service worker config
Used the standard workbox from [Google's guide](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/guides/get-started).

Configured for PWA with react using [Medium's guide](https://imranhsayed.medium.com/setup-pwa-workbox-webpack-plugin-for-react-application-workbox-window-precaching-caching-at-40f9289650e5).
