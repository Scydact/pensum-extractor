# Notes for myself

## To deploy to gh-pages
Run `npm run deploy`. It will automatically call `npm run predeploy`, which contains `npm run build`.

Thanks to [this guide](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages/tree/master).

For more info, check [gh-pages npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages).


## Beautiful hooks
This React page is using [Beautiful React Hooks](https://antonioru.github.io/beautiful-react-hooks/).
